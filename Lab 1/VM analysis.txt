How does the VM performance change as the number of CPU cores and memory 
increases? Why?

CPU increases the amount of work that can be done with speed, and there will be a higher
performance... Memory is associated with the number of things you can do within
that program and the amount of content that can be held... because the more processing
power and space in the VM, the closer your performance to your physical machine, and the more 
processing power and memory space, the better the performance.

Can you notice a change in the performance of the host operating system when changing 
the virtual machine settings? Why or why not?

Resources are allocated to the VM via the physical machine; I did not notice much of a change
on the host operating system, but if the host machine did not have enough ram and space
the VM would be slower and more restricted.


Can you change the VM settings, so they are the same as the physical or host machineâ€™s 
settings?

No, because to do that, it will take complete resources of the host machine to copy the hoit.
That is not economical.


Is the VM usable? Why, or why not? 

It is manageable; I feel for it to function effortlessly, It needs substantially more
resources allocated to the VM.
